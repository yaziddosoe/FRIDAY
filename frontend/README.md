# Agent Starter for React

This is a starter template for [LiveKit Agents](https://docs.livekit.io/agents) that provides a simple voice interface using [Agents UI](https://livekit.io/ui) components and [LiveKit JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-js). It supports [voice](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai), [transcriptions](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/text/), and [virtual avatars](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/avatar).

Also available for:
[Android](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-android) • [Flutter](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-flutter) • [Swift](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-swift) • [React Native](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-react-native)

### Features:

- Real-time voice interaction with LiveKit Agents
- Camera video streaming support

- Virtual avatar integration
- Light/dark theme switching with system preference detection
- Customizable branding, colors, and UI text

This template is built with Next.js and is free for you to use or modify as you see fit.

### Project structure

This starter uses the [Agents UI](https://livekit.io/ui) components for core UI elements like media controls, audio visualizers, chat transcripts, and providing session data. Shadcn installs components into `components/` folder so you can customize them like any other local component.

```
agent-starter-react/
├── app/
│   ├── api/
├── components/
│   ├── agents-ui/     - Agents UI components
│   ├── app/           - App-specific components
│   ├── ui/            - Primitive shadcn/ui components
├── fonts/
├── hooks/
├── lib/
├── public/
└── package.json
```

Business logic lives within the `components/app` folder. It's here where the application's state and behavior is managed and the various Shadcn UI components are composed together.

| File                  | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.tsx`             | Initializes the application and LiveKit session. Sets up the agent session provider, audio start button, and error toasts.                           |
| `view-controller.tsx` | Manages the transitions between the welcome and session views based on the LiveKit session state.                                                     |
| `welcome-view.tsx`    | Renders the welcome UI when the LiveKit session is not connected.                                                                                     |
| `blocks/agent-session-view-01` | The session view: chat transcript, media tiles, audio visualizer, and control bar.                                                             |
| `theme-provider.tsx`  | Configures light/dark theme switching using the system preference.                                                                                    |
| `theme-toggle.tsx`    | Renders the theme toggle button.                                                                                                                      |

### Component usage

Most Agents UI components require access to a LiveKit session object for access to values like agent state or audio tracks. A Session object can be created from a [TokenSource](/reference/client-sdk-js/variables/TokenSource.html), and provided by wrapping the component in an [AgentSessionProvider](/reference/components/shadcn/component/agent-session-provider).

See [`components/app/app.tsx`](./components/app/app.tsx) for an example of how this is done in this app.

### Customizing components

Agents UI components, like most Shadcn components, take as many primitive attributes as possible. For example, the [AgentControlBar](/reference/components/shadcn/component/agent-control-bar/page.mdoc) component extends `HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>`, so you can pass any props that a div supports. This makes it easy to extend the component with your own styles or functionality.

You can edit any Agents UI component's source code in the `components/agents-ui` directory. For style changes, we recommend passing in tailwind classes to override the default styles. Take a look at the source code to get a sense of how to override a component's default styles.

### Updating components

To update the Agents UI components to the latest publication, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm shadcn:install
```

> [!NOTE]
> The CLI will ask before overwriting any modified files so you can avoid losing any customizations you might have made.

### Installing components

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @agents-ui/{component-name-a} @agents-ui/{component-name-b}
```

## Getting started

Run the following command to automatically clone this template.

```bash
lk app create --template agent-starter-react
```

Then run the app with:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

And open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You'll also need an agent to speak with. Try our starter agent for [Python](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-python), [Node.js](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-node), or [create your own from scratch](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai/).

## Configuration

This starter is designed to be flexible so you can adapt it to your specific agent use case. Branding, feature toggles, and UI text are set directly in the components that use them — see [`app/layout.tsx`](./app/layout.tsx) for branding (logo, colors, page title/description) and [`components/app/view-controller.tsx`](./components/app/view-controller.tsx) for feature toggles and the audio visualizer.

#### Audio visualizer presets

Set `audioVisualizerType` in [`components/app/view-controller.tsx`](./components/app/view-controller.tsx) to switch visualizer styles:

- `bar` (default): vertical bars with optional `audioVisualizerBarCount`
- `grid`: dot grid with `audioVisualizerGridRowCount` and `audioVisualizerGridColumnCount`
- `radial`: circular bars with `audioVisualizerRadialBarCount` and `audioVisualizerRadialRadius`
- `wave`: oscilloscope-style wave with `audioVisualizerWaveLineWidth`
- `aura`: shader-based aura with `audioVisualizerAuraColorShift`

Use `audioVisualizerColor` to set a shared accent color across all visualizer modes.

#### Environment Variables

You'll also need to configure your LiveKit credentials in `.env.local` (copy `.env.example` if you don't have one):

```env
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_livekit_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_livekit_api_secret
LIVEKIT_URL=https://your-livekit-server-url

# Agent dispatch (https://docs.livekit.io/agents/server/agent-dispatch)
# Leave AGENT_NAME blank to enable automatic dispatch
# Provide an agent name to enable explicit dispatch
AGENT_NAME=
```

These are required for the voice agent functionality to work with your LiveKit project.
